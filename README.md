This application was built with vanilla Javascript.

I followed the tutorial for building this app from: CodingTheSmartWay.com

What I've learned from building this app:

There are Six data types that are primitives:

-Boolean
-Null and Undefined
-Number
-String
-and Object

I can add properties to almost everything

Functions are objects

-Using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries, many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries.

In Javascript, all variables declared with the var keyword are scoped to their declaring function. 
That means if I want to make sure my variables aren’t global, I should put them in a function, and then call that function.

There are still a lot to learn on my JavaScript journey.
